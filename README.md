# Respond-and-Recover-from-a-Data-Breach
Analyzed vulnerabilities in Google Cloud Security Command Center, remediated issues in Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and Firewall. Implemented best practices to enhance security and recover from a simulated data breach, demonstrating cloud security and incident response skills.




Respond and Recover from a Data Breach
Project Overview
This project is part of the Google Cloud Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and focuses on responding to and recovering from a data breach using Google Cloud tools and best practices. The primary objective was to identify vulnerabilities in a cloud environment, remediate security issues, and implement robust measures to ensure recovery and protection against future incidents.

Key Activities
Vulnerability Analysis:

Conducted a thorough examination of the Google Cloud Security Command Center to identify potential security gaps and vulnerabilities.
Analyzed configuration settings and access controls across Google Cloud services, including Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and Firewall.
Issue Remediation:

Addressed identified vulnerabilities by implementing security best practices and recommended configurations.
Corrected issues related to misconfigured firewall rules, insecure storage buckets, and other common security concerns.
Best Practices Implementation:

Applied security best practices to enhance overall cloud security posture, including:
Enforcing encryption for data at rest and in transit.
Implementing proper access controls and IAM policies.
Regularly reviewing and updating security configurations.
Incident Recovery:

Developed and executed a recovery plan to mitigate the impact of the simulated breach.
Restored affected services to a secure state and validated the effectiveness of the recovery measures.
Notes
No Screenshots: The project was executed directly on the Google Cloud Console, and as such, no screenshots are available. All tasks were performed through the console interface, and the configuration details and results are documented within the project files and reports.
Conclusion
This capstone project demonstrated practical skills in cloud security management, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. It provided hands-on experience with Google Cloud's security tools and reinforced the importance of proactive security measures and effective incident recovery strategies.
